Lignocellulosic biomass is an abundant waste stream which represents a rich source of glucose monomers and is currently underutilised due to ineffective current processing technology. The Edinburgh iDEC team is therefore looking into the generation of new mutant libraries with increased enzymatic activity. Libraries were generated by two differing methodologies. Sequence Saturation Mutagenesis is a random mutagenesis method which has been successfully optimised in this study, resulting in a 5-fold increase in DNA yields, enhancing subsequent library generation. Moreover, the need for expensive phosphorothioate nucleotides has been made redundant by incorporating a novel shearing method using sonication, allowing for greater accessibility to this directed evolution technique for future studies. Additionally, a library was successfully designed using the GeneORator method, in which secondary shell active site residues were targeted with the degenerate NNK codon. Preliminary high-throughput screening suggests active variants are present, however, further sequencing and kinetic studies are required.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#idec-2021-edinburgh","text":"","title":"iDEC 2021 | Edinburgh"},{"location":"team/","text":"Our Team The University of Edinburgh iDEC is based in the Institute of Quantitative Biology, Biochemistry and Biotechnology (IQB3) which brings together a range of backgrounds to tackle fundamental questions in biology and to develop biology-based solutions to real-world problems.

RESULTS NOTES: the 2uM iodine concentration failed to produce a smear at both 70 degres and room temperature and in both genes. At the same time, the iodo fragmentation run at 70 degrees showed to be the best performing in both genes and at all concentrations of dATPaS 30/6/21 Received the parts from IDT.

July 2021 6/07/21 Dynabeads protocol suggests to use a slightly different protocol from the one suggested by Wong et al 2004, so we decided to follow the first. Moreover, the Dynabeads instructions state to use purified DNA, while Wong et al. didn' t specify it. We prepared a new batch of binding and washing buffer according to dynabeads' manufacturer instruction and followed those (3 washing with 1x B&W solution and 2 washing with NaOH) we carried out two PCR batch each (25 ul each) we tested each step in the dynabeads purification by nano-dropping the discarded fluid at each step to assess at what critical point we usually lose the most DNA. We split one PCR product (50 ul) into two 25 ul, purified one with the QiaQuick PCR purification kit and one kept raw and run the results: purified PCR initial DNA incubation loss w1 w2 loss in NaOH incub. loss NaOH loss SDS boiling tot recovery: %tot lost concentration after QIAquick final yield QIAquick yields ng/ul 148.6975 48.174 \\<0 \\<0 33.86 15.1 3.25 tot (ng) 3717.4375 2408.7 846.5 64.8% 22.8% 377.5 10.15% 87.57% 97.5 2.6% 25.8% non-purified PCR mean: 148.6975 60.43 \\<0 \\<0 24.12 9.06 1.73 tot (ng) 3717.4375 3021.5 603 81.3% 16.2% 226.5 6.09% 97.50% 51.9 1.4% 22.9% Trouble-shooting After confrontation with supervisors and other researchers, we decided to test a few more things. Moreover, the QIAquick nucleotide removal kit has shown to be less efficient than forecasted (~25% yield only instead of about 50%). we ordered a new kit: Monarch\u00aePCR & DNA Cleanup Kit (NEB) as QIAquick was clearly responsible for a great loss of DNA along the process, never going above ~25% We began a new cycle of SeSaM from the beginning. using the same PCR protocol as before, but increasing the number of cycles to 45 to increase DNA yield. First, we purified the primers lest they could contain traces of freebiotin that would saturate the beads. PCR product and Iodine fragmentation were performed as previous experiments. then we pset a new experiment with 4 different tubes for PCR: PCR with biotinylated-purified-forward-primers PCR with beads coated in purified forward primers PCR with biotinylated-reverse-primers (non-purified) PCR with normal Primers The third would be the control for full length genes, to gain knowledge about how much the fragmentation impacts the QIAquick and dynabeads extraction, while the forth was a negative control to see if the purification would impact the results. 100 ul each 9/7/21 primer purification performed. diluted biotinylated forward primers (BFP) and biotinylated ul of stock Primers were diluted to 10mM (1:10) to a final volume of 100 ul, then purified with the QIAquick nucleotide removal. efficiency prooved to be low once again before QIAquick: Forward: 43.71 ng/ul *100 ul =4371 ng reverse: 42.44 ng/ul *100 ul =4244 ng after QIAquick: Foerward: 27 ng/ul *30ul = 810 ng reverse: 36 ng/ul * 30ul = 1080 ng 18 and 25% recovery rate respectively. 12/07/21 200 ul beads used for PCR number 2 and incubated with 20.5 ul of purified BFP (80 pmol tot) at Room temperature for 1.30 hours The four PCR reactions were then set up over night with the previous reported protocol, except for an increase number of cycles of for a total of 45. The PCR reaction made with the forward-primer-coated-beads, was not added of the forward primers and their volume in water was added to compensate the lack. 14/7/21 The three reactions with the forward biotinylated primers were incubated with Iodine (as previously indicated) and then purified with dynabeads (PCr with coated dynabeads skipped the incubation step) The incubation and the NaOH discarded liquids were collected and nanodropped (data reported in table).

Moreover, the Dynabeads instructions state to use purified DNA, while Wong et al. didn' t specify it. We prepared a new batch of binding and washing buffer according to dynabeads' manufacturer instruction and followed those (3 washing with 1x B&W solution and 2 washing with NaOH) we carried out two PCR batch each (25 ul each) we tested each step in the dynabeads purification by nano-dropping the discarded fluid at each step to assess at what critical point we usually lose the most DNA.

Moreover, the QIAquick nucleotide removal kit has shown to be less efficient than forecasted (~25% yield only instead of about 50%). we ordered a new kit: Monarch\u00aePCR & DNA Cleanup Kit (NEB) as QIAquick was clearly responsible for a great loss of DNA along the process, never going above ~25% We began a new cycle of SeSaM from the beginning. using the same PCR protocol as before, but increasing the number of cycles to 45 to increase DNA yield. First, we purified the primers lest they could contain traces of freebiotin that would saturate the beads. PCR product and Iodine fragmentation were performed as previous experiments. then we pset a new experiment with 4 different tubes for PCR: PCR with biotinylated-purified-forward-primers PCR with beads coated in purified forward primers PCR with biotinylated-reverse-primers (non-purified) PCR with normal Primers The third would be the control for full length genes, to gain knowledge about how much the fragmentation impacts the QIAquick and dynabeads extraction, while the forth was a negative control to see if the purification would impact the results. 100 ul each 9/7/21 primer purification performed. diluted biotinylated forward primers (BFP) and biotinylated ul of stock Primers were diluted to 10mM (1:10) to a final volume of 100 ul, then purified with the QIAquick nucleotide removal. efficiency prooved to be low once again before QIAquick: Forward: 43.71 ng/ul *100 ul =4371 ng reverse: 42.44 ng/ul *100 ul =4244 ng after QIAquick: Foerward: 27 ng/ul *30ul = 810 ng reverse: 36 ng/ul * 30ul = 1080 ng 18 and 25% recovery rate respectively. 12/07/21 200 ul beads used for PCR number 2 and incubated with 20.5 ul of purified BFP (80 pmol tot) at Room temperature for 1.30 hours The four PCR reactions were then set up over night with the previous reported protocol, except for an increase number of cycles of for a total of 45. The PCR reaction made with the forward-primer-coated-beads, was not added of the forward primers and their volume in water was added to compensate the lack. 14/7/21 The three reactions with the forward biotinylated primers were incubated with Iodine (as previously indicated) and then purified with dynabeads (PCr with coated dynabeads skipped the incubation step) The incubation and the NaOH discarded liquids were collected and nanodropped (data reported in table).

The directed evolution of proteins comprises a collection of molecular biology techniques that aims to improve a particular feature of a protein in order to generate a more robust, stable or catalytically active variant in comparison to its original wildtype. This is typically acquired through repeated cycles of mutagenesis, in which variants are either selected or screened in a subsequent process in order to identify mutants with improved desirable features. Random mutations naturally occur due to environmental factors or biological errors and are the basis of the evolutionary process. However, these mutations are typically seldom and therefore not contingent to positive variant identification without deliberate action. Mutations of the protein of interest are therefore induced in laboratories in a variety of ways in a process known as library generation . Mutants that arise from the library are transformed into a protein-expressing chassis and compared to the original wild-type strain in order to identify those with improved function of interest. In laboratory settings, directed evolution techniques can create an artificial human-controlled evolutionary pressure, and increase the mutation rate by isolating the gene from its original host, creating a large amount of copies with various mutations. In this way we can simulate thousands or hundreds of thousands of generations in a short period of time and select the best mutants for our purpose while generating useful data about the structure and function of the protein itself. How are mutant libraries typically generated? The mutagenesis of the gene can be carried out in a variety of different ways, and the chosen method is typically dictated by the amount of available data and information on the protein of interest prior to the study. These methods are usually grouped in two separate classes; random mutagenesis and rational design. Random mutagenesis is used to induce mutations at random throughout the gene of interest in a way that simulates natural mutagenesis through the imperfect replication of DNA. Rational design, on the other hand, is adopted when data relating to structure and functionally relevant amino acid residues is available. Specific residues and structural motifs can then be targeted in a fashion which limits the size of the library generated through its targeted approach, however can also increase the probability of positive variant outcomes through its optimised design. The Edinburgh iDEC 2021 team has investigated the library generation techniques of enzymes relevant to the degradation of recalcitrant polymers that are abundant in modern waste streams. Random mutagenesis One of the most widespread methods adopted by laboratories willing to generate mutant libraries is error-prone polymerase chain reaction (epPCR). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a molecular biology technique that harnesses the ability of a thermostable protein called DNA Polymerase to exponentially duplicate a strand of DNA. However, some polymerases, such as Taq Polymerase are not perfect in their proof-reading ability, a property which is exploited in epPCR to induce single mutations throughout the gene. Some mutations are capable of subsequently altering the amino acid residue of the primary sequence despite codon redundancy, thereby generating mutants with a variation of fitness levels across the sequence space. epPCR has proved a successful technique for library generation across a variety of studies, ultimately leading to variants with improved activity or stability. However, epPCR is prone to mutational bias, typically favouring A\u2981T\u27f6G\u2981C and G\u2981C\u27f6A\u2981T and therefore does not truly represent the essence of random mutagenesis. Additionally, despite epPCR typically representing multiple iterations to increase the number of point mutations per variant, it is statistically highly improbable that mutations are induced next to each other, a phenomenon which is seen as important in positive variant identification due to the epistatic relationship between mutations. The University of Edinburgh iDEC team has therefore explored and proposed an alternative method for random mutagenesis library generation which builds upon the inherent bias of Taq polymerase in order to increase the random mutational frequency of library generation for future directed evolution studies. What is Sequence Saturation Mutagenesis (SeSaM)? SeSaM is a relatively overlooked and undervalued random mutagenesis method which was formulated to build upon the mutational spectrum of epPCR. First developed in the Schwaneberg lab of RWTH Aachen University, its highly innovative design harnesses the use of 5' biotinylated primers, the weakened phosphate backbone of \u03b1-thio deoxynucleotides, and the degeneracy of universal nucleotides. Essentially, the incorporation of \u03b1-thio deoxynucleotides such as dATP\u03b1S are randomly incorporated throughout the gene of interest in an initial PCR. After incubation with iodine, the PCR product is sheared at every position where there is a dATP\u03b1S. The 5' forward biotinylated fragments are then isolated using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads from the other fragmented DNA and the reverse strand is melted away with a DNA melting solution. A universal base which is capable of base-pairing with any of the four canonical dNTPs is conjugated to the 3' end of the forward fragment by terminal transferase. Two more subsequent PCRs generate the full length gene and replace the universal base with canonical dNTPs, ultimately generating a mutant library throughout the gene. Figure 1 Graphical Summary of the SeSaM Protocol. dATP\u03b1S is a phosphorothioate nucleotide which weakens the phosphate backbone. Two PCR reactions are initially run in parallel. The first (1.A.ii) utilises the Cex forwards (biotinylated) and Cex reverse primers and dATP\u03b1S. dATP\u03b1S is randomly incorporated into the PCR product at positions where there is an adenine residue. The PCR product is then incubated with iodine, fragmenting the strands at every position where there is a dATP\u03b1S. Alternatively, here we propose a more cost-effective strategy for DNA shearing of the forward biotinylated strand using sonication (1.A.i). The forward fragments are then isolated with streptavidin coated magnetic Dynabeads, recovering only the 5' biotinylated fragments, the length of which is determined by the position of the first phosphate backbone nick on the forward strand. The fragments are then elongated with terminal transferase, incorporating deoxyinosine monophosphate (dIMP) to the 3' ends of the forward fragments. The second PCR reaction (2) utilises the Cex forwards and Cex reverse (biotinylated) primers. The PCR product is purified, and the 5' biotinylated reverse template is isolated with Dynabeads. The products of (1) and (2) are then combined to elongate the DNA to the full-length gene in PCR reaction (3). A final PCR reaction (4) replaces the universal base with standard nucleotides and amplifies the mutant library with Cex forwards and Cex reverse primers. As the primers contain BsmbI and BsaI sites, the mutated genes would be able to assemble into pJUMP18-Uac and pJUMP29-1A and transformed for further application and screening. Adapted from (Wong _et al._ 2004). Why did the team optimise SeSaM? The team optimised a variety of technicalities throughout the SeSaM protocol in a way that makes the method more reproducible for future research interested in random mutagenesis library creation for protein directed evolution. SeSaM is an uncommon method and underreported in literature. We hope that our experience can increase its use in research. Our method can now be viewed in our Protocol page. Additionally, the team generated an alternative to the SeSaM process which seeks to decrease the cost of the method, thereby increasing the accessibility of the method to more laboratories with an interest in directed evolution. Owing to the high cost of the \u03b1-thio deoxynucleotides potentially creating a barrier to entry of the method, we have developed and optimised an alternative to the DNA shearing method using a standard sonicator. The sonicator, a typical device found in biological laboratories to lyse cells, and similarly shear DNA randomly throughout the gene. This was proven to be successful in generating a mutant library for our gene of interest and represents a novel undertaking in the directed evolution space. Rational Design Mutagenesis Rational design mutagenesis targets specific amino acid residues of the protein of interest based on prior publicly-available data and information. The use of degenerate NNK codons, where N can be any standard nucleotide (A, T, G or C) and K the keto-group containing nucleotides (T or G), renders this methodology semi-rational, due to the saturation of the residue with all 20 canonical amino acids. Relevant to this project is the targeting of the residues comprising the secondary shell of the active site. It is understood that by coordinating the active site of the enzyme, but not the conserved catalytic amino acid residues themselves, the activity of the enzyme can be increased [1]. A method devised by Sadler and colleagues was followed to generate the library for future screening efforts [2]. Figure 2 Schematic Representation of GeneORator Library Generation using Mutagenic Primers. An asymmetric PCR (A) involving a limiting amount of mutagenic forward primers was combined with the Cex reverse primer to generate single stranded mutagenic reverse primers. The mutagenic megaprimer was then quantified and set up in a subsequent PCR (B) with the Cex forwards primer to produce rationally designed mutant library. Adapted from Sadler et al. (2018).

The University of Edinburgh iDEC team has therefore explored and proposed an alternative method for random mutagenesis library generation which builds upon the inherent bias of Taq polymerase in order to increase the random mutational frequency of library generation for future directed evolution studies.","title":"Random mutagenesis"},{"location":"project/Introduction/#what-is-sequence-saturation-mutagenesis-sesam","text":"SeSaM is a relatively overlooked and undervalued random mutagenesis method which was formulated to build upon the mutational spectrum of epPCR. First developed in the Schwaneberg lab of RWTH Aachen University, its highly innovative design harnesses the use of 5' biotinylated primers, the weakened phosphate backbone of \u03b1-thio deoxynucleotides, and the degeneracy of universal nucleotides. Essentially, the incorporation of \u03b1-thio deoxynucleotides such as dATP\u03b1S are randomly incorporated throughout the gene of interest in an initial PCR. After incubation with iodine, the PCR product is sheared at every position where there is a dATP\u03b1S. The 5' forward biotinylated fragments are then isolated using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads from the other fragmented DNA and the reverse strand is melted away with a DNA melting solution. A universal base which is capable of base-pairing with any of the four canonical dNTPs is conjugated to the 3' end of the forward fragment by terminal transferase. Two more subsequent PCRs generate the full length gene and replace the universal base with canonical dNTPs, ultimately generating a mutant library throughout the gene. Figure 1 Graphical Summary of the SeSaM Protocol. dATP\u03b1S is a phosphorothioate nucleotide which weakens the phosphate backbone. Two PCR reactions are initially run in parallel. The first (1.A.ii) utilises the Cex forwards (biotinylated) and Cex reverse primers and dATP\u03b1S. dATP\u03b1S is randomly incorporated into the PCR product at positions where there is an adenine residue. The PCR product is then incubated with iodine, fragmenting the strands at every position where there is a dATP\u03b1S. Alternatively, here we propose a more cost-effective strategy for DNA shearing of the forward biotinylated strand using sonication (1.A.i). The forward fragments are then isolated with streptavidin coated magnetic Dynabeads, recovering only the 5' biotinylated fragments, the length of which is determined by the position of the first phosphate backbone nick on the forward strand. The fragments are then elongated with terminal transferase, incorporating deoxyinosine monophosphate (dIMP) to the 3' ends of the forward fragments. The second PCR reaction (2) utilises the Cex forwards and Cex reverse (biotinylated) primers. The PCR product is purified, and the 5' biotinylated reverse template is isolated with Dynabeads. The products of (1) and (2) are then combined to elongate the DNA to the full-length gene in PCR reaction (3). A final PCR reaction (4) replaces the universal base with standard nucleotides and amplifies the mutant library with Cex forwards and Cex reverse primers. As the primers contain BsmbI and BsaI sites, the mutated genes would be able to assemble into pJUMP18-Uac and pJUMP29-1A and transformed for further application and screening.

SeSaM is an uncommon method and underreported in literature. We hope that our experience can increase its use in research. Our method can now be viewed in our Protocol page. Additionally, the team generated an alternative to the SeSaM process which seeks to decrease the cost of the method, thereby increasing the accessibility of the method to more laboratories with an interest in directed evolution. Owing to the high cost of the \u03b1-thio deoxynucleotides potentially creating a barrier to entry of the method, we have developed and optimised an alternative to the DNA shearing method using a standard sonicator. The sonicator, a typical device found in biological laboratories to lyse cells, and similarly shear DNA randomly throughout the gene.

The use of degenerate NNK codons, where N can be any standard nucleotide (A, T, G or C) and K the keto-group containing nucleotides (T or G), renders this methodology semi-rational, due to the saturation of the residue with all 20 canonical amino acids. Relevant to this project is the targeting of the residues comprising the secondary shell of the active site. It is understood that by coordinating the active site of the enzyme, but not the conserved catalytic amino acid residues themselves, the activity of the enzyme can be increased [1].

Synthetic biology is a relatively novel multidisciplinary field of science in which biological systems and parts are rationally designed and engineered for particular outcomes.

Ranging from the bioremediation of toxic industrial chemicals in our natural environment, to the development of complex biomaterials with carbon negative production processes and recently to the rewiring of human immune systems in the face of global pandemics, synthetic biology is touted to be on the verge of an inflexion point with human development.

Why do we need a circular economy? The circular economy has become a recent buzzword across a multitude of multinational and start-up companies, as well as green governmental agendas. It captures the ideology of limiting the continued extraction of resources from our natural environment by harnessing the materials and resources that are currently in circulation within our economies, thereby eliminating the generation of waste and diminishing our carbon footprint and the pressure we exert on our ecosystems. This is in stark contrast to the functioning of our current economies, in which resources are intensively extracted at scale in a way that is unsustainable to future development.

Being the most common polysaccharide on this planet, it is estimated that 1 billion tonnes of the common agricultural waste stream will be made available annually within the European Union[1]. However, in its polymeric form it is of little value due to its complex crystalline structure which has evolved to specifically withstand enzymatic and microbial attack [2]. The highly valuable glucose monomers are locked within the complex matrix and inaccessible to industrial processes that do not employ harsh, economically and environmentally unsustainable methods for their extraction [3]. Therefore, the majority of the waste material is either burnt or composted in favour of a conventional linear economic model. In realising the circular bioeconomy of the future, sugar feedstocks will become an increasingly valuable agricultural product, and with our global food production system already under strain by our ever-growing population, other sources of sugar production will be required for our society to maintain the health of our planet. Bioethanol is a highly recognised bioproduct and its production from second generation feedstocks such as lignocellulosic biomass stands at the forefront of a circular bioeconomy[4,5]. However, the pace of synthetic biology within industrial manufacturing capabilities promises a wide range of products which will require a vast amount of glucose to become available for the metabolic manufacturing revolution [6,7]. The sourcing of sugar from overexploited, high land and water intensive primary feedstocks will not work to produce these products, as the sustainability of the end-product reflects its manufacturing process. The implementation of waste streams using novel manufacturing technologies is an important research area and the primary motivation for the team's objectives. What is 'the SuperGrinder'? The University of Edinburgh 2021 iDEC team was initially conceived from the University's international genetically engineered machine (iGEM) competition team. With an eye towards the role synthetic biology can play in new sustainable manufacturing and waste processing practices, the team set out to devise a new concept for the reintroduction of important waste streams that are present on a large scale across our global society. Faced with a large global population on a small and strained planet, our focus is to limit the amount of resources that we extract from the natural environment by harnessing the resources that are already available to us in an industrialised society. However, some waste streams are difficult to manage due to their biologically complex structure and recalcitrant nature, limiting their recyclability within our current infrastructure framework. The University of Edinburgh 2021 iDEC and iGEM teams have therefore designed a novel machine, the SuperGrinder, which merges enzymatic and mechanical forces to enhance the degradation potential of these waste streams in a way that is conducive to further downstream and upcycling purposes.

Wong et al. (2004) suggested that the random integration of the phosphorothioate nucleotide dATP\u03b1S in the first PCR product is cleaved at room temperature with 2\u03bcM iodine. On the other hand, Wong et al. (2008) states 2mM iodine at 70oC. Our result indicated that the 2 \u03bcM iodine failed to cleave DNA at any incubation condition (Figure 1). A higher concentration of iodine at a higher temperature exhibited more cleavage as observed by the extent of smearing. Therefore, 2 mM iodine at 70\u00b0C was chosen for further SeSaM studies. The original SeSaM procedure stipulates the need for three separate DNA purification kits which inherently increases the cost of the method. For this reason, SeSaM was initially tested using the QIAquick Nucleotide Removal kit for every step due to its proposed ability to retain short oligonucleotides. However, DNA concentration measurements throughout the experiment indicated that a high percentage of DNA was being lost throughout the process, resulting in a loss of library variation and increasing the risk of failure. DNA concentration readings showed a significant loss of DNA at several steps throughout the method which was at odds with the theoretical yield. This was particularly noticeable in the Dynabeads elution step and its subsequent purification (Figure 2). After many iterations, it was found that the Dynabeads protocol provided in the SeSaM paper differed in comparison to the manufacturer's protocol. The SeSaM paper suggests using 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 with 1 mM EDTA and 1 M NaCl as a wash buffer, whilst the manufacturer's protocol uses 5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 with 0.5 mM EDTA and 1 M NaCl. Additionally, the immobilisation of DNA on the Dynabeads was changed from 20 minutes on a rotating platform to 1 hour in a rotator mixer in the proposed optimised protocol. The Dynabeads immobilisation yield was subsequently improved with these adjustments with an average yield of 19.5% from the method from the original paper to 56.3% in the optimised protocol, representing a 2.8x increase in yield. Figure 2 DNA Quantity Tracking throughout SeSaM Protocol and Optimisation. FB: forward 5'-biotinylated fragment DNA. RB: reverse 5'-biotinylated template DNA. The SeSaM protocol represents the protocol as stated in Wong et al. (2004). The optimised protocol is the protocol suggested in this study Another potential cause for the significant DNA loss is the ssDNA purification, from which it was speculated that the QIAquick Nucleotide Removal kit was not suitable. Approximately 81.3% of DNA was lost after the purification. Ultimately, the Monarch\u00ae PCR & DNA Cleanup Kit was utilised using the specified protocol for ssDNA purification. This kit seemed to significantly mitigate the DNA loss since only 42.0% of DNA was lost (Figure 3). Overall, the total amount of DNA retained represents a 5-fold increase between the SeSaM protocol and our optimised protocol. Figure 3 DNA Quantity Tracking with Differing Clean-up Kits. The QIAquick Nucleotide Removal kit was found to have too low a yield for effective library generation. Instead the Monarch PCR & DNA clean-up kit was used following the protocol for ssDNA purification, increasing the yield of DNA. DNA Fragmentation: dATPaS Concentration & Novel Sonication Calibration The gene of interest is fragmented in the SeSaM protocol in order to allow terminal transferase to conjugate a universal base on the 3' end of the forward fragment to induce mutagenesis. The original SeSaM protocol utilises dNTPaS incorporated into the gene of interest for subsequent random shearing across the full gene-length. This must be calibrated to the length of the gene in order to maximise the mutational frequency across the entire gene. The optimum dATPaS concentration for the gene of interest, Cex ( Cellulomonas fimi ), was determined to be 0.1 mM (Figure 4). Figure 4 dATP\u03b1S Concentration Calibration Experiment. Fragmented DNA by an occurring smear on a gel. (1) 1kb NEB DNA ladder, (2) Negative control: PCR reaction with no dATP\u03b1S, (3) 0.5 mM dATP\u03b1S, (4) 0.3 mM dATP\u03b1S, (5) 0.2 mM dATP\u03b1S, (6) 0.1 mM dATP\u03b1S, (7) 0.05 mM dATP\u03b1S. To achieve maximal mutational frequency, all phosphorothioate nucleotides of dCTP\u03b1S, dGTP\u03b1S and dTTP\u03b1S, as well as dATP\u03b1S would be required to be purchased to cleave the gene at every nucleotide position. Owing to the high cost of these modified bases, an alternative DNA shearing method was performed by sonication to explore more accessible alternatives to achieving greater mutational spectra. Various rounds of sonication were performed and are depicted in Figure 5. Increasing the rounds of sonication decreases the concentration of the full-length gene and increases the size of the smear. Much like the calibration experiment with dATP\u03b1S, a long smear with minimal full-length gene is desirable to increase the mutational spectrum of the method.

SeSaM Mutant Library Generation The generation of a mutant library using the phosphorothioate dATP was tracked using gel electrophoresis (Figure 6). Using the aforementioned optimised protocol, both full-length forward 5'-biotinylated DNA and the reverse 5'-biotinylated DNA template were successfully achieved in a sufficient amount to proceed. Unfortunately, the final PCR step, in which the universal base is replaced with standard nucleotides, failed to produce the expected PCR product. The reaction was repeatedly modified by changing several conditions including the annealing temperature, quantity of full-length gene template, and additionally purifying DNA with ethanol precipitation. However, the PCR product was observed as a smear on the agarose gel, and not as a full-length gene product as expected. The method was assumed to have failed for this reason.

Figure 7 Final PCR product obtained from the optimised SeSaM. The Cex-alphaS full-length and Cex-sonicated full-length were loaded on gel in the equivalent amount as in the PCR mixture. pJUMP19_Cex was amplified as a positive control and both Cex-alphaS and Cex-sonicated were set in a PCR with three different concentrations of template: 1 ng, 30 ng, and 60 ng. The sample fragmented by sonication was successfully produced, however the sample fragmented by dATP\u03b1S always appeared as a smear for an unknown reason. Mutant Library Sequencing The resulting product was successfully assembled via Golden Gate assembled and cloned into E. coli DH5a. Colonies with successful colony PCR results were plasmid extracted and sent for sequencing for the confirmation of mutations with the gene.
