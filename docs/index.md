This wiki template was built using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). You are by no means confined to use this template. In fact, you are encouraged to build your own unique **static site** that best suits your project, and you are free to use any framework you like.

Should you decide to use this wiki, however, we have a [tutorial](https://wiki.idec.io/team_wiki/mkdocs.html) to walk you through the basics.
