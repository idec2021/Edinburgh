# Our Team
The University of Edinburgh iDEC is based in the Institute of Quantitative Biology, Biochemistry and Biotechnology (IQB3) which brings together a range of backgrounds to tackle fundamental questions in biology and to develop biology-based solutions to real-world problems.

## Team Lead

**Charles Wackwitz**

Charles is a Dutch national, a graduate in BSc Biotechnology from University College London and a recent graduate in MSc Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology from the University of Edinburgh. His interests lie in the practical application of our knowledge of biology and the environment in developing a truly fair and sustainable circular bioeconomy.

## Team Players

**Danghatai (Baifern) Wongthanaroj **

Baifern is a Thai national with years of experience across synthetic biology research areas as well as a BSc in Biochemistry from Chulalongkorn University. Having recently graduated with an MSc in Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology, her interests lie in waste upcycling, metabolic engineering, and their application within a circular economy framework.

**Finn Slattery**

Finn is a British national and a recent graduate from the MSc programme in Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology. Alongside his degree in BSc Marine Biology from the University of Tampa, Finn is also an avid swimmer, diver and overall enthusiast of the marine world. His research interests lie in biomaterials and the biological extraction of chitin from crab shells

**Davide Annese**

Davide is a passionate Italian from Turin where he did his undergraduate degree in BSc Biology at the University of Turin. Having also recently graduated with an MSc in Synthetic Biology and Biotechnology, Davide is a visionary scientist with a keen interest in artistic applications of synthetic biology and genetic engineering to biodesign, as well as a keen interest in plant synthetic biology.

Chris is a professor of microbial biotechnology in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Edinburgh. His research includes developing methods to engineer novel biological systems using modular parts and standardised assembly methods to generate artificial genetic networks. His lab is currently researching novel biosensors for the detection of contaminants in the environment and developing genetic modules for the efficient conversion of cellulosic biomass to useful products.

**Nadanai Laohakunakorn**

Nadanai is a Chancellor&#39;s Fellow in Biotechnology at IQB3 at the University of Edinburgh. His research focuses on the development and programming of cell-free systems for biological protein synthesis. This allows for the rapid, inexpensive and sustainable production of products for healthcare, environmental monitoring and biomanufacturing of chemicals and materials.

**Joanna Sadler**

Joanna is a Chancellor&#39;s Fellow in Biotechnology at IQB3 at the University of Edinburgh. Her research interest lies in using synthetic biology alongside synthetic chemistry to develop industrially relevant methods to valorise plastic waste into high value small molecules. She is also actively researching new biocompatible plastic degradation technologies and harnessing plastic waste as a feedstock from microbial growth.
